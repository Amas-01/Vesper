## 📋 Overview

Vesper is a decentralized payment streaming protocol built on Stacks that enables real-time, per-block sBTC payroll distributions. Instead of monthly or weekly payouts, Vesper allows employers and service providers to stream payments continuously, with recipients able to withdraw their earnings on-chain as they accrue.

### ✨ Key Features:
- ⏱️ **Per-block streaming**: Payments settle every Stacks block (~10 minutes)
- ₿ **sBTC integration**: Secure Bitcoin settlement via Stacks sBTC
- 🗳️ **DAO governance**: Token holders vote on protocol parameters and upgrades
- ❌ **Cancellable streams**: Payers can cancel active streams with customizable escrow models
- 📦 **Batch payroll**: Pay multiple recipients in a single transaction
- 📊 **Analytics dashboard**: Real-time tracking of payment streams and DAO governance
